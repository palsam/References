Coupling and Cohesion
  While programming, keeping the modules simple is critical. If the design complexity increases, there is more likely to introduce a bug.
  There should be a way to evaluvate the desing complexity.
  Metric used to evaluvate this complexity is Coupling and Cohesion.
  
  Coupling - Focus on the complexity between a module and other module
  Cohesion - Focus on the complexity with in the Module
  
  
2 Difference between git merge and git rebase:
  Git merge will create a new merge commit, poluting the feature branch. 
  But rebase re-writes the project history by creating brand new commits for each commit in the original branch.
