Coupling and Cohesion
  While programming, keeping the modules simple is critical. If the design complexity increases, there is more likely to introduce a bug.
  There should be a way to evaluvate the desing complexity.
  Metric used to evaluvate this complexity is Coupling and Cohesion.
  
  Coupling - Focus on the complexity between a module and other module
  Cohesion - Focus on the complexity with in the Module
